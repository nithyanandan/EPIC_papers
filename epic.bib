	Abstract = {An 8 X 8 equals 64 element digital interferometer was developed at Waseda University (1989 - 1995). It was an equally spaced two dimensional array of 2.4 m dishes at 10.6 GHz, and a 2D FFT processor was used for Nyquist rate imaging. Recently a spatial-temporal (2 + 1)D FFT processor has been developed for pulsar survey (1996 - 2000), in which a first 2D spatial FFT transforms the electric fields of coordinate represented to those of momentum represented. We obtain the electric fields in each 64 direction at Nyquist rate by the 2D spatial Fourier transform. The following temporal 1D FFT gives the spectrum of 64ch or 256ch to 64 directions respectively also at Nyquist rate. The total bandwidths of each direction are 20 MHz and the resulting frequency resolutions are 20/64 MHz or 20/256 MHz. For sensitive pulsar survey, we also have developed an interferometric array of 20 m spherical dishes in Nasu flat, 160 km north of Tokyo. Five dishes are completed at present. Normal temperature receivers of high electron mobility transistors (HEMT) are used at 1.4 GHz observation and the receiver noise temperatures are below 40 K. Expected rms detection limit (Delta) T is about 10-2K under the condition of 20 MHz band widths and 1s integration time. Preliminary results of zenith survey at (delta) equals 40 deg using a single dish show (Delta) T equals 0.03 K without switching. Sub-reflectors and feed horns were designed so as to observe 5 deg off directions from zenith and they rotate around Az axis. It enable us to survey the declination zone of 32 &lt;EQ (delta) &lt;EQ 42 deg.},

	Abstract = {A new digital backend has been developed for the Basic Element for SKA Training II (BEST-2) array at Radiotelescopi di Medicina, INAF-IRA, Italy, which allows concurrent operation of an FX correlator, and a direct-imaging correlator and beamformer. This backend serves as a platform for testing some of the spatial Fourier transform concepts which have been proposed for use in computing correlations on regularly gridded arrays. While spatial Fourier transform-based beamformers have been implemented previously, this is, to our knowledge, the first time a direct-imaging correlator has been deployed on a radio astronomy array. Concurrent observations with the FX and direct-imaging correlator allow for direct comparison between the two architectures. Additionally, we show the potential of the direct-imaging correlator for time-domain astronomy, by passing a subset of beams though a pulsar and transient detection pipeline. These results provide a timely verification for spatial Fourier transform-based instruments that are currently in commissioning. These instruments aim to detect highly redshifted hydrogen from the epoch of reionization and/or to perform wide-field surveys for time-domain studies of the radio sky. We experimentally show the direct-imaging correlator architecture to be a viable solution for correlation and beamforming.},

	Abstract = {We are developing the Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Re-ionization (PAPER) to detect 21 cm emission from the early universe, when the first stars and galaxies were forming. We describe the overall experiment strategy and architecture and summarize two PAPER deployments: a four-antenna array in the low radio frequency interference (RFI) environment of Western Australia and an eight-antenna array at a prototyping site at the NRAO facilities near Green Bank, WV. From these activities we report on system performance, including primary beam model verification, dependence of system gain on ambient temperature, measurements of receiver and overall system temperatures, and characterization of the RFI environment at each deployment site. We present an all-sky map synthesized between 139 MHz and 174 MHz using data from both arrays that reaches down to 80 mJy (4.9 K, for a beam size of 2.15e--5 sr at 156 MHz), with a 10 mJy (620 mK) thermal noise level that indicates what would be achievable with better foreground subtraction. We calculate angular power spectra ( C ℓ ) in a cold patch and determine them to be dominated by point sources, but with contributions from galactic synchrotron emission at lower radio frequencies and angular wavemodes. Although the sample variance of foregrounds dominates errors in these power spectra, we measure a thermal noise level of 310 mK at ℓ = 100 for a 1.46 MHz band centered at 164.5 MHz. This sensitivity level is approximately 3 orders of magnitude in temperature above the level of the fluctuations in 21 cm emission associated with re-ionization.},

	Abstract = {A number of experiments are currently working toward a measurement of the 21 cm signal from the epoch of reionization (EoR). Whether or not these experiments deliver a detection of cosmological emission, their limited sensitivity will prevent them from providing detailed information about the astrophysics of reionization. In this work, we consider what types of measurements will be enabled by the next generation of larger 21 cm EoR telescopes. To calculate the type of constraints that will be possible with such arrays, we use simple models for the instrument, foreground emission, and the reionization history. We focus primarily on an instrument modeled after the ~0.1 km 2 collecting area Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array concept design and parameterize the uncertainties with regard to foreground emission by considering different limits to the recently described "wedge" footprint in k space. Uncertainties in the reionization history are accounted for using a series of simulations that vary the ionizing efficiency and minimum virial temperature of the galaxies responsible for reionization, as well as the mean free path of ionizing photons through the intergalactic medium. Given various combinations of models, we consider the significance of the possible power spectrum detections, the ability to trace the power spectrum evolution versus redshift, the detectability of salient power spectrum features, and the achievable level of quantitative constraints on astrophysical parameters. Ultimately, we find that 0.1 km 2 of collecting area is enough to ensure a very high significance ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] {gsim} 30σ) detection of the reionization power spectrum in even the most pessimistic scenarios. This sensitivity should allow for meaningful constraints on the reionization history and astrophysical parameters, especially if foreground subtraction techniques can be improved and successfully implemented.},
