% Basic setup. Most papers should leave these options alone.
\documentclass[a4paper,fleqn,usenatbib]{../mnras}

% MNRAS is set in Times font. If you don't have this installed (most LaTeX
% installations will be fine) or prefer the old Computer Modern fonts, comment
% out the following line
\usepackage{newtxtext,newtxmath}
% Depending on your LaTeX fonts installation, you might get better results with one of these:
%\usepackage{mathptmx}
%\usepackage{txfonts}

% Use vector fonts, so it zooms properly in on-screen viewing software
% Don't change these lines unless you know what you are doing
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% BODY OF PAPER %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Introduction}

Motivate problem of calibrating direct imagers. Reference Nithyas paper. \citep{mor11}

\section{Mathematical Framework}

Introduce notation, describe measurement equation.


\begin{equation}
\mathcal{C}^n(a,\spix,f) \equiv \left<E_a(f) E'^*(\spix,f)\right>_t
\end{equation}
$\mathcal{C}^n(a,\spix,f) \rightarrow \Cna$

\begin{equation}
\Er{a} = g_a E^T_a
\end{equation}
\begin{align}
\hat{E}(\spix) & = \frac{1}{\Nant} \sum_i e^{2\pi i \spix \cdot \ri} \Erest{i} \\
& = \frac{1}{\Nant} \sum_i e^{2\pi i \spix \cdot \ri} \sum_b \beamr_b(\ri-\rb) \Erest{b} \\
& = \frac{1}{\Nant} \sum_i e^{2\pi i \spix \cdot \ri} \sum_b \beamr_b(\ri-\rb) h^{(n)}_b g_b\Er{b}^T
\end{align}
We can then play a trick to transform the beam.
\begin{align}
\hat{E}(\spix) & = \frac{1}{\Nant} \sum_b h^{(n)}_b g_b\Er{b}^T e^{2\pi i \spix \cdot \rb}\sum_i \beamr_b(\ri-\rb)e^{2\pi i \spix \cdot (\ri-\rb)}\\
& = \frac{1}{\Nant} \sum_b h^{(n)}_b g_b\Er{b}^T e^{2\pi i \spix \cdot \rb}\beamtheta_b(\spix)
\end{align}

Plugging in, we get,
\begin{align}
\Cna & = \left<\Er{a} \hat{E}^*(\spix)\right>_t \\ 
& = \left<g_a \Er{a}^T \frac{1}{\Nant} \sum_b h^{*(n)}_b g^*_b\Er{b}^{*T} e^{-2\pi i \spix \cdot \rb} \beamtheta^*_b(\spix)\right>_t \\
\end{align}
Pulling time independent pieces out.
\begin{align}
\Cna & = \frac{g_a}{\Nant} \sum_b h^{*(n)}_b g^*_b \beamtheta^*_b(\spix) e^{-2\pi i \spix \cdot \rb} \left<\Er{a}^T \Er{b}^{*T} \right>_t \\
& = \frac{g_a}{\Nant} \sum_b h^{*(n)}_b g^*_b \beamtheta^*_b(\spix) e^{-2\pi i \spix \cdot \rb} \V^T_{ab}
\end{align}
Solve for $g^{(n+1)}_a$.
\begin{equation}
g^{(n+1)}_a = \Cna \Nant \left[ \sum_b h^{*(n)}_b g^{*(n)}_b \beamtheta^*_b(\spix) e^{-2\pi i \spix \cdot \rb} \V^T_{ab} \right]^{-1}
\end{equation}

In the case where $h_b = 1/g_b$, this simplifies slightly.
\begin{equation}
g^{(n+1)}_a = \Cna \Nant \left[ \sum_b \beamtheta^*_b(\spix) e^{-2\pi i \spix \cdot \rb} \V^T_{ab} \right]^{-1}
\end{equation}


\section{Simulation}

Describe simulation

\section{Verification}

Connect to either cramer-rao or FX solutions in some way


% \subsection{Figures and tables}

% Figures and tables should be placed at logical positions in the text. Don't
% worry about the exact layout, which will be handled by the publishers.

% Figures are referred to as e.g. Fig.~\ref{fig:example_figure}, and tables as
% e.g. Table~\ref{tab:example_table}.

% % Example figure
% \begin{figure}
% 	% To include a figure from a file named example.*
% 	% Allowable file formats are eps or ps if compiling using latex
% 	% or pdf, png, jpg if compiling using pdflatex
% 	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{example}
%     \caption{This is an example figure. Captions appear below each figure.
% 	Give enough detail for the reader to understand what they're looking at,
% 	but leave detailed discussion to the main body of the text.}
%     \label{fig:example_figure}
% \end{figure}

% % Example table
% \begin{table}
% 	\centering
% 	\caption{This is an example table. Captions appear above each table.
% 	Remember to define the quantities, symbols and units used.}
% 	\label{tab:example_table}
% 	\begin{tabular}{lccr} % four columns, alignment for each
% 		\hline
% 		A & B & C & D\\
% 		\hline
% 		1 & 2 & 3 & 4\\
% 		2 & 4 & 6 & 8\\
% 		3 & 5 & 7 & 9\\
% 		\hline
% 	\end{tabular}
% \end{table}

% The best way to enter references is to use BibTeX:

\bibliographystyle{../mnras}
\bibliography{../epic} % if your bibtex file is called example.bib


% Alternatively you could enter them by hand, like this:
% This method is tedious and prone to error if you have lots of references
